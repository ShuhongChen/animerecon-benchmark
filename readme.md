This repo downloads the AnimeRecon benchmark dataset introduced in [PAniC-3D: Stylized Single-view 3D Reconstruction from Portraits of Anime Characters](https://github.com/ShuhongChen/panic3d-anime-reconstruction).  As described in that repo, this downloader will add to `./_data/lustrous`


## setup
